        \item More generally, an image is a $q$-dimensional array of values belonging to $R^d$.

\begin{frame}{The role of annotated image databases}

  Image databases including \emph{annotations} (typically some kind of high level information) are essential to the development of \emph{supervised} machine learning methods for image analysis.

  \begin{block}{Annotations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Image class
    \item Measure(s) obtained from the image
    \item Position of objects within the image
    \item Segmentation

\begin{frame}{MNIST database \tiny{\cite{lecun_gradient-based_1998}}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database contains $60\,000$ training images of hand-written digits, and $10,000$ test images.
  \item Image size: $28 \times 28$
  \item It has been used since 1998
  \item Human performance on a similar database (NIST) is reported to be around $1.5\%$ error \cite{simard_efficient_1993}
  \item Best methods, based on convolutional neural networks, give around $0.21\%$ test error.

\begin{frame}{Image classification problem}

  Classification problem:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Input: image $\x$
  \item Output: class $y \in \{ label_1, label_2, \ldots, label_q\}$
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Class coding}
    Often, classes are denoted by integers, but this is only a coding commodity. For instance, it would be meaningless to use a regression approach for this problem.
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Class coding}

  If there are $q$ possible classes, then a class will be coded as a vector $\y$ of length $q$. If its class is $r$  then for $0 \leq i < q$:
  \[
  \y[i] =
  \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if}\ i=r \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]

  \begin{block}{Example with $4$ classes}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Label $0 \longmapsto [1,0,0,0]$
    \item
      Label $1 \longmapsto [0,1,0,0]$

      \item This approach is not feasible...
      \item Moreover, this approach does not take into account the local structure of images.

\begin{frame}{Activations}

  Different activations (typically ReLU) can be used in the intermediate layers.
  \vspace{1em}

  Concerning the last layer: Given that the aim is a vector containing zeros except for a one, two designs are commonly used:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Loss function for classification: cross-entropy}

  The preferred loss function for classification is cross-entropy:

  \begin{block}{}
    For $\y$ in $[0, 1]^d$ and $\hat{\y}$ in $]0, 1]^d$:
        \[
        H(\y, \hat{\y}) = \sum_{i=1}^d \y_i \log(\hat{\y}_i)
        \]
  \end{block}

  \pause

  \begin{alertblock}{}
    For this to work, each $\hat{\y}_i$ must be strictly positive. Therefore when used in a NN the cross-entropy has to be preceded by a convenient operator, such as a sigmoid or a softmax.
  \end{alertblock}

  \pause

  Note that the binary cross-entropy we saw during the first lecture is a particular case of cross-entropy.

  \frametitle{Conclusion on fully-connected networks for image classification}

  Fully connected layers:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item scale badly to large size images

  \item do not take into account the local structure of images

  \end{itemize}


  Today:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Fully-connected networks are almost never used for image analysis.
  \item Fully-connected layers are only used in the middle (auto-encoders) or at the end (classification) of the pipeline.

\begin{frame}{Dimension reduction}

  $1 \times 1$ convolutions are used to reduce the number of filters - this is called by some authors \emph{dimension reduction}.

  Many successful architectures, especially for image classification, follow the same pattern:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Several iterations of: One or several convolutional layers, with increasing depth, followed by max pooling
  \item A few fully connected layers
  \end{enumerate}

  \frametitle{Some deep learning libraries}

  Deep learning is a very competitive domain, where code sharing is very common.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Tensorflow, by Google (Apache licence)
  \item PyTorch, Torch (Facebook - BSD licence)
  \item Caffe (Univ. of California, Berkeley - BSD licence)
  \item Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (MIT licence)
  \item MatConvNet (for MatLab users)
  \item Theano (Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms; not maintained anymore)
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Comments}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Most of these libraries are distributed with very permissive licences
    \item Most of them use Python as prototyping language
    \item \emph{Keras} is a very easy to use interface to Tensorflow, Theano and CNTK.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{A revolution in image analysis}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Deep learning has brought an undeniable break-through in image analysis (as in other fields)
  \item A significant part of research efforts in image analysis today is based on deep learning
  \item Its applications are ubiquitous
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{Limitations}

  For a deep-learning solution to work, you need:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item Enough annotated data
  \item A lot of fiddling (different architectures; hyper-parameters; optimization)
  \item One (or, even better, several) powerful GPUs

  \end{itemize}

  Moreover, these models lack interpretability.
